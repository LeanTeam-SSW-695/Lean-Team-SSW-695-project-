Performance Requirements:
Attributes	Expectations	Constraints
Application Throughput, response time per transaction	< 2 seconds	REST API interaction between two system
Application Utilization rate 	75%	NA
System Response time to establish server connection	< 2minutes	NA

Business Requirements:
 
1.	The Portal app should comply with all legal government regulations so that potential business activities are not affected by lawsuits and/or government interference.
2.	The application should be copyright-registered so that rivals cannot copy our work. To prevent copyright lawsuits, however, the application should not be identical to an existing application.
3.	Profit margins should rise for a certain percent per year.
4.	Updates must be published on a regular basis to keep the application up to date and mitigate threats such as security breaches, which can lead to the theft of personal information such as disclosure of user personal information and payment details.
5.	The app should be more appealing to potential users, by providing ads on social media.
